## Project Description

- Learned to use Autodesk Fusion 360 software and its Workspaces - Design, Animation, Simulation, Drawing & Generative Design.
- Learned to develop 2D and 3D designs of various mechanical components used in manufacturing processes and assemble them .
- Learned how to design some necessary parts of an airplane such as wings, fuselage, fins, etc using various features of Fusion 360.
- Learned to work in teams and developed freeform models like aircraft,remote controller ,fan, camera, house, kitchen, boat, etc.
- Prepared documentation of the project and delivered midterm and endterm presentation in the Science & Technology Council
